Regarding above story : Since the Display name field will be visible when 'DOL' is checked..
What should be done if a user selects DOL and adds Display Name. 
And now goes and unchecks 'DOL'. Do we keep the display name value in backend or clear it ?
Since that field is no more visible on frontend after uncheck.
But still present in API.

In above stated scenario, we have to clear the display name value. ( When DOL is unchecked )
